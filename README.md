# Real-time-data-from-Kinect
This is a modified version of a project which was done by MarekKowoski. You can find the original project in here: https://github.com/MarekKowalski/LiveScan3D . This modified version uses a TCP-IP connection and sends real-time data from each Kinect on a specific port number, so any other program like matlab can read the data from the port number and use it.  If you use this software in your research, then please use the following citation:  Kowalski, M.; Naruniec, J.; Daniluk, M.: "LiveScan3D: A Fast and Inexpensive 3D Data Acquisition System for Multiple Kinect v2 Sensors". in 3D Vision (3DV), 2015 International Conference on, Lyon, France, 2015

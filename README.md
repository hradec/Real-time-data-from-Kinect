# Real-time-data-from-Kinect
This is a modified version of a project which was done by MarekKowoski. 
You can find the original project in here: https://github.com/MarekKowalski/LiveScan3D . 
This modified version uses a TCP-IP connection and sends real-time data from each Kinect on a specific port number, 
so any other program like matlab can read the data from the port number and use it. 

Licensing

The main version of the project is licensed as follow(which can be applied to the modified versions too):
